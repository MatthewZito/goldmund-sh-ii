  "about": {
    "0": "Welcome. I'm a software developer with a focused expertise in JavaScript development and its surrounding ecosystem, full stack web development, and frontend architecture. I'm currently employed by an insurtech software company where I develop micro-frontends and cross-domain state sharing solutions for a heavily distributed, microservice-oriented system.",
    "1": "As an engineer, I'm especially interested in industrial, fault tolerant systems; reactive / event-based systems; concurrency and async I/O; and modeling consensus in browser-native environments. Software aside, I enjoy music archiving and learning about visual and performing arts.",
    "2": "It's an oft-repeated aphorism that to understand something acutely one must be able to teach it, and that has motivated me to host a blog whereby I can share some of the things I've learned about computing and software design. I'll otherwise probably share some observations, thoughts, and musings from time to time."
